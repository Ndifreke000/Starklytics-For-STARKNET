### Example Submission

```
Query Link: https://example.com/query/starknet-analysis-2025

Dashboard Link: https://example.com/dashboard/tvl-trends

Comments:
I analyzed Starknet transaction patterns over the last 30 days. 
The query aggregates data from 5 major DeFi protocols and 
calculates daily transaction volumes, gas usage, and active users.

The dashboard visualizes these metrics with interactive charts 
showing peak activity times and protocol comparisons.

Key findings:
- Peak activity: 2-4 PM UTC
- Average daily transactions: 15,000+
- Top protocol: Uniswap V3 (45% of volume)

I encountered some data gaps on Jan 15-16 due to RPC issues, 
but worked around them using historical data.
